amc2moodle, is conversion tool to recast multiple choice quiz written with the LaTeX format used by automuliplechoice 1.0.3 into the moodle XML quiz format.

It is based on LaTeXML for a first step conversion of the LaTeX  file into XML. Then a set of transformation is applied in python and with XSLT stylesheet to conform to moodle XML format. Most of LaTeX possibilities are supported (equations, tables, graphics, user defined commands). The question can then be imported in the moodle question bank using category tags.

The automuliplechoice LaTeX format is convienient and can be used for preparing test and avoiding moodle web gui for multiple choice questions.

For more information, installation, usage, dependancies and to see the limitations, please have a look on amc2moodle.pdf.
